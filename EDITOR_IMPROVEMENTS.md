# Editor Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines all the improvements made to the CodeCanvas IDE editor interface, including resizable panels, live preview, AI diff highlighting, keyboard shortcuts, and enhanced mobile responsiveness.

---

## 1. Resizable Panels ✅

### Implementation
- **Library**: `react-resizable-panels` (already installed v2.1.7)
- **Components Used**: `ResizablePanelGroup`, `ResizablePanel`, `ResizableHandle`

### Features
- **File Tree Panel**: Resizable (10-30% width), collapsible
- **Editor Panel**: Resizable, nested vertical layout with terminal
- **Terminal Panel**: Resizable (15-50% height), collapsible
- **AI Panel**: Resizable (20-40% width), collapsible
- **Preview Panel**: Resizable (20-50% width), collapsible

### User Experience
- Drag handles between panels for custom sizing
- Visual grip indicators on resize handles
- Minimum and maximum size constraints
- Panel sizes persist within session
- Smooth transitions and responsive layout

---

## 2. Live Preview with Auto-Refresh ✅

### Implementation
- Preview iframe auto-refreshes when files are saved
- Manual refresh button added to preview header
- Key-based iframe refresh mechanism

### Features
- **Auto-refresh on save**: Preview updates immediately after file save
- **Manual refresh**: Click refresh icon in preview header
- **Iframe key mechanism**: Forces complete reload of preview content
- **Mobile support**: Full-screen preview on mobile devices

### Usage
1. Enable preview with **Cmd/Ctrl+P** or Preview button
2. Edit and save file (Cmd/Ctrl+S)
3. Preview automatically refreshes
4. Click refresh icon for manual refresh

---

## 3. AI Panel with Diff Highlighting ✅

### Implementation
- Custom `DiffViewer` component for visualizing code changes
- Automatic code extraction from AI responses
- Toggle between raw response and diff view

### Features
- **Code Detection**: Automatically detects code blocks in AI responses (```language ... ```)
- **Diff Visualization**: 
  - Green highlights for additions
  - Red highlights for deletions
  - Side-by-side comparison with line numbers
- **Apply Code**: One-click application of AI-suggested code changes
- **Toggle View**: Switch between text response and diff view

### Diff Algorithm
- Line-by-line comparison
- Smart detection of additions/removals
- Look-ahead matching for better accuracy

### Usage
1. Ask AI to refactor/generate code
2. AI response shows "View Diff" button if code detected
3. Click "View Diff" to see changes highlighted
4. Click "Apply Code" to insert changes into editor

---

## 4. Keyboard Shortcuts ✅

### Comprehensive Shortcuts

#### File Operations
- **Cmd/Ctrl + S**: Save current file

#### Panel Toggles
- **Cmd/Ctrl + B**: Toggle file tree
- **Cmd/Ctrl + J**: Toggle terminal
- **Cmd/Ctrl + K**: Toggle AI panel
- **Cmd/Ctrl + P**: Toggle preview

#### Commands
- **Cmd/Ctrl + R**: Run dev server (`npm run dev`)
- **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + B**: Build project (`npm run build`)

### Shortcuts Dialog
- Click keyboard icon in top bar to view all shortcuts
- Organized by category
- Visual key indicators
- Quick reference for productivity

---

## 5. Enhanced Panel Layout & Mobile Responsiveness ✅

### Desktop Layout
- **Horizontal ResizablePanelGroup** (file tree | editor+terminal | AI | preview)
- **Vertical ResizablePanelGroup** for editor/terminal split
- All panels fully resizable and collapsible
- Toggle buttons in top bar with tooltips

### Mobile Layout
- **Non-resizable** fixed-height panels for better touch experience
- **Collapsible sections**: File tree, terminal, AI panel
- **Full-screen preview**: Preview opens as overlay on mobile
- **Touch-optimized**: Quick actions menu with large buttons
- **Responsive heights**: Optimized panel heights for mobile screens

### Panel Visibility Controls
- Icon buttons in top bar for quick panel toggles
- Visual indicators showing panel state
- Keyboard shortcuts for fast toggling
- Mobile menu with grouped actions

---

## 6. Additional Improvements

### Save Button
- Visual save button in top bar
- Disabled state when no unsaved changes
- Shows immediately when file is modified

### Preview Enhancements
- Refresh button in preview header
- Live reload on file save
- Better mobile experience

### AI Panel Enhancements
- Code extraction and diff viewing
- Apply code with one click
- Copy button for responses
- Mode-specific prompts (Explain, Refactor, Generate, Review, Test)

### Developer Experience
- Tooltips showing keyboard shortcuts
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Consistent component styling
- Test IDs for automated testing

---

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
1. `/client/src/pages/editor.tsx` - Main editor implementation with resizable panels
2. `/client/src/components/editor/ai-panel.tsx` - Added diff highlighting and code extraction

### Created
1. `/client/src/components/editor/diff-viewer.tsx` - Diff visualization component
2. `/client/src/components/editor/keyboard-shortcuts-dialog.tsx` - Shortcuts reference dialog

### Existing (Already Available)
- `/client/src/components/ui/resizable.tsx` - Resizable panel components (from shadcn/ui)

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [showFileTree, setShowFileTree] = useState(true)
const [showAiPanel, setShowAiPanel] = useState(true)
const [showTerminal, setShowTerminal] = useState(true)
const [showPreview, setShowPreview] = useState(false)
const [previewKey, setPreviewKey] = useState(0)
```

### Resizable Panel Configuration
```typescript
<ResizablePanelGroup direction="horizontal">
  <ResizablePanel defaultSize={15} minSize={10} maxSize={30}>
    {/* File Tree */}
  </ResizablePanel>
  <ResizableHandle withHandle />
  <ResizablePanel defaultSize={50} minSize={30}>
    <ResizablePanelGroup direction="vertical">
      {/* Editor + Terminal */}
    </ResizablePanelGroup>
  </ResizablePanel>
  {/* AI Panel & Preview */}
</ResizablePanelGroup>
```

### Diff Viewer Algorithm
- Simple line-by-line diff (not full Myers algorithm)
- Look-ahead matching for better accuracy
- Color-coded changes (green/red)
- Preserves whitespace and formatting

---

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile Safari and Chrome on iOS/Android
- Touch events for mobile devices
- Responsive breakpoints at 768px

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Persistent Panel Sizes**: Save panel sizes to localStorage
2. **Custom Keyboard Shortcuts**: Allow users to customize shortcuts
3. **Advanced Diff**: Implement Myers diff algorithm for better accuracy
4. **Syntax Highlighting in Diff**: Add Monaco syntax highlighting to diff viewer
5. **Split Editor**: Side-by-side file editing
6. **Panel Layouts**: Save/load custom panel layouts
7. **Minimap in Diff**: Visual overview of large diffs
